# On the Robust Estimation of Spatial Autoregressive Models

This repository code contain template code associated with the manuscript "Cokrig-and-Regress for Spatially Misaligned Data" by [Tho](https://rsfas.anu.edu.au/about/staff-directory/zhi-yang-tho), [Hui](https://francishui.netlify.app/), [Welsh](https://cbe.anu.edu.au/about/staff-directory/professor-alan-welsh), and [Zou](https://cbe.anu.edu.au/about/staff-directory/dr-tao-zou).

# Getting started

There are currently two directories in this repository:

-   `Code`, which contains `R` scripts implementing the proposed cokrig-and-regress (CNR) and parametric bootstrap method along with other scripts for simulating spatially misaligned data and performing L-nearest-matching-and-regress (L-NMR). Many of the functions in these scripts contain pseudo-help files. 

-   `Simulation`, which contains template script to implement the simulation study in the manuscript. **Users are recommended to start here by examining `Template_Simulation_Script.R` to understand how to use CNR and the associated bootstrap procedures, among other methods.**

# If you find any bugs and issues...

If you find something that looks like a bug/issue, please use Github issues and post it up there. As much as possible, please include in the issue:

1.  A description of the bug/issue;
2.  Paste-able code along with some comments that reproduces the problem. If you also have an idea of how to fix the problem, then that is also much appreciated;
3.  Required data files etc...

Alternatively, please contact the corresponding author at [ZhiYang.Tho\@anu.edu.au](mailto:ZhiYang.Tho@anu.edu.au).
